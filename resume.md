## Professional Experience
### **Smart Savannahs**
#### *Volunteer Project*
- With funding from the Ingram Scholars Program, designed and constructed custom ESP32 microcontroller-based smart camera systems for real-time wildlife monitoring and reporting of threats to enhance anti-poaching efforts by local ecorangers in South African reserves.
- Worked with professors from Sweden/South Africa to develop custom tinyML models for accurate identification of wildlife.

### **Trail of Bits**
#### *Software Engineering Wintern*
- Developed a system for efficient data collection and scraping as well as localized training and fine-tuning of LLMs on analyzed code, improving the performance of code-generation models for languages with less publicly available training data.

### **Trail of Bits**
#### *Security Engineering Associate*
- Researched use of machine learning systems in software security analysis and developed a framework for analyzing the
effectiveness of particular models in code understanding and identification of software vulnerabilities
- Performed security audits of cloud-computing infrastructure and machine learning frameworks

### **Dupper Analytics**
#### *Software Engineer | Part-Time*
- Developed customized client web and mobile applications that increased the velocity of data capture for small Colorado
companies and launched new data visualization features
- Worked upwards to lead a team of 7 employees working on the DACS project and managed client communications for
several of Dupper Analytics’ Colorado clients
- In charge of cloud infrastructure and SQL database management along standard roles as a developer
