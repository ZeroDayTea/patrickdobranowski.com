I am a current student, researcher, and software engineer passionate about computer science, mathematics, and physics.

Specifically, I love systems, security, languages, and pure mathematics. In these realms, I am particularly interested in topics of low-level low-latency programming, systems security, machine learning, type theory, and algebra/group theory with applications in scientific computing, engineering, finance, and making computers *go really fast*.

With my focus on cybersecurity, I am actively involved in CTF competitions with various teams (including FMC and .;,;.), both nationally and internationally, in addition to a slew of bug bounty programs that I hack on focusing primarily on binary exploitation and web exploitation.

My academic interests currently lie in the realm of computational physics and simulation software applied to the fields of quantum optics and quantum electrodynamics. I have also previously worked on privacy-preserving machine learning developing DNN techniques for detecting deepfake audio content.

I also love learning about linguistis and philosophy and am an avid climber/mountaineer and wildlife conservationist.
