I am a current student, researcher, and software engineer passionate about computer science, mathematics, and physics.

Specifically, I love systems-level programming, security, and high performance computing. In this realm, I am particularly interested in low-level programming, systems research, and machine learning with applications in scientific computing, finance, and making computers *go really fast*.

With my focus on cybersecurity, I am actively involved in CTF competitions both nationally and internationally in addition to a slew of bug bounty programs that I hack on. I focus primarily on binary exploitation and reverse engineering, combining my passion for systems-level computer science, but also have a lot of experience in web app exploitation.

My academic research currently lies in computer science but more specifically the realm of computational physics and simulation software. I am currently working with Dr. Kalman Varga on quantum simulation software for nanoscale interaction of light and matter as well as with researchers at ELI-ALPS and University of Szeged on models for high-order harmonic generation and quantized fields. I previously worked on privacy-preserving machine learning and ML security where I worked with Dr. Dan Lin on developing deep neural network techniques for detecting altered media/deepfakes and protecting against adversarial techniques.

I have previously worked at Trail of Bits as a Vulnerability Researcher/Security Engineer where I was involved in researching applications of machine learning systems in security analysis and performing security audits of various targets. I also formerly cofounded Dupper Analytics where I worked as a Software Engineer building web and mobile applications for increasing the velocity of data capture in clients primarily in the Colorado area.
